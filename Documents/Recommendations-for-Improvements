# DemoQA Testing Suggested Improvements

## Code Improvements

### Break down the page controllers 

The elementsPageController.js page was starting to get really bloated, it would be a good idea to break it down into separate page object models for each component type, one for elements, one for windows, one for alerts, will be easier to maintain and to read.

### Naming convention
The naming convention picked was camel case, but it could be easier to read with snake case, also methods could probably use some more descriptive but brief names

## CI/CD Pipeline Integration

A CI/CD pipeline that automatically runs tests when code changes are pushed to the repository, would speed up bug catching and issues could be fixed earlier, make test results available for the entire team, and it would guarantee tests are run in a standardized environment.


## Test Parallelization

Running multiple test suites or test cases simultaneously across different environments or containers, would reduce test execution time, makes sures resources are being utilized efficiently, and we can test on different environments simultaneously.

##  Visual Regression Testing

Automated comparison of UI screenshots to detect unintended visual changes.
It's easier to catch visual errors through automation than it is manually checking for changes.
Guarantees UI is standardized in different browsers and environments.

## Code Quality Tools

Implementing tools like a Linter and Prettier speeds up test case creation by preventing  problematic patterns and enforce consistent coding standards.

Adding Typescript would help to prevent type errors and provides autocompletion for Cypress commands.

Implementing SonarCloud provides deeper static analysis on code quality, security, and maintainability, tracks code duplication, complexity, test coverage, and potential bugs.
